Give us four hours and your laptop, and we'll send you into NICAR with a fully-functioning data-crunching machine and the knowledge to use it.
One of the biggest hurdles to learning programming is the often bewildering process of setting up your computer. Veteran programmers and data crunchers from Reveal from The Center for Investigative Reporting will give you a virtual playground on your personal laptop that will allow you to explore all the tools you'll gather throughout the conference. In this four-hour workshop, we'll introduce crucial programming concepts and tools and -- most importantly -- why we use them.
You'll walk into conference sessions with a laptop loaded with many of the tools presenters will be talking about, and a leg up as you continue developing your skills once you're back home.

,Finding the story: Open policing data,2018-03-08,11:30 a.m.,2018-03-08,12:30 p.m.,False,"Cheryl Phillips - Researchers at Stanford University examined the records from more than 60 million state patrol stops in 20 states between 2011 and 2015.

This workshop will help journalists adapt the data and produce stories from it. While the data analysis by Stanford covers 20 states, researchers say they have found consistent trends that speak to national issues and have released data for 30 states. The project is currently collecting data from county and city jurisdictions and expects to process, normalize and release that data as well.

Data journalism is more fragile than most people realize.

We'll talk about strategies data journalists can use to preserve their own work and how news organizations can better preserve their valuable digital assets. Finally, we'll report on how journalists, librarians and scholars are thinking about future-proofing the news.
