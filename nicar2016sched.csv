Give us four hours and your laptop, and we'll send you into NICAR with a fully-functioning data-crunching machine and the knowledge to use it.
One of the biggest hurdles to learning programming is the often bewildering process of setting up your computer. Veteran data crunchers and programmers from Reveal/The Center for Investigative Reporting will give you a virtual playground on your personal laptop that will allow you to explore all the tools you'll gather throughout the conference. In this four-hour workshop, we'll introduce crucial programming concepts and tools and -- most importantly -- why we use them.
You'll walk into conference sessions with a laptop loaded with many of the tools presenters will be talking about, and a leg up as you continue developing your skills once you're back home.

After mastering the basics of writing code, you need to understand how to design programs. To that end, this class will explore Python language features that will help you write readable, reliable and reusable code.
Preregistration is required and seating is limited. Laptops will be provided for the training.
Session prerequisites: Experience with basic Python language features like variables, data types, conditionals and functions are required. 
Attendees must be registered for the conference to attend this session.

,Amazon cloud basics,2016-03-11,9:00 a.m.,2016-03-11,10:00 a.m.,Scott Klein,"Cloud servers are an amazingly flexible way to use computing resources. Servers and test benches used to take weeks to order and configure, but thanks to the cloud, you can build up arbitrarily complex farms of computers to do your bidding in a few minutes, from serving a dynamic news app to crunching through a data set to trying out a new technology on the cheap. This course will help you understand the thicket of acronyms and programs that make up Amazon's AWS system and will get you started building servers.
All you need is a normal Amazon account. Before the class, go to http://aws.amazon.com/ and click ""sign up,"" and follow the instructions so you've got an account ready. Important note: We'll build actual servers and then turn them off, which may cost a few dollars.

Usually the first step is using a relational (or SQL) database. While a relational database can be a good choice for some datasets, data analysts today turn to new tools to gain deeper insight. This talk will show how we can use a graph database to analyze highly connected data using examples from U.S. Congressional data and political email archives. Using the U.S. Congress data, we'll show you how to explore the dataset using Cypher, the Neo4j query language, to discover legislator activity including bill sponsorship and voting activity. Building up our knowledge of Cypher as we progress, we'll show how you can use principles from social network analysis to find influential legislators and discover what topics legislators have influence over. Finally, we will examine how to draw insights from the Hillary Clinton email dataset, released as part of a FOIA request earlier this year. We will explore this dataset as a graph of interactions among users, answering questions like: Who is communicating with Hillary the most? What are the topics of these emails? You'll learn how to visualize these using the Neo4j browser to quickly make sense of the data as we are exploring.
The goal of this talk is to provide a demonstration of database tools that any journalist can use to explore datasets and draw insights from connected datasets.

Try to find as much information that can help you move the story forward with a watchdog eye. Set the clock as a timer for 5- to 10-minute intervals to see how quickly you can find information. Once you're done, compare yourself to others in the room. This is a real life scenario where you can learn to break news by never leaving your computer.

As a result, we've ended up finding and creating some open source tools to integrate these pieces into an extensible system for tracking this information and tying it to the people who are involved. In this session we'll share the tools that we've assembled and how they might be reused.

The goal is to help participants understand how networks view them as users, how they can shape what a network sees and how to realistically defend themselves against common attacks. We'll cover some security tools and techniques, but the class is focused on understanding the networked environment well enough that attendees can tailor these to their particular situation. First, we'll look at the networks we use every day, how we relate to them and how they are used by others. Next, we'll go over some real-world attack examples that range from direct hacking, traffic analysis and implicit information to jurisdictional attacks, such as subpoenas. The last third of the workshop will be an open discussion where participants can talk about their specific needs and potential next steps.
